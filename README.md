# WRO-Future-Engineer
**- Welcome to our GitHub repository for the WRO Future Engineers Self-Driving Cars competition! Here, we document our journey, share resources, and collaborate on developing our self-driving car solution.**

# ABOUT US :

 **+ We are a team of passionate engineers and enthusiasts participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition. Our team consists of ROKAYA EDRISSI , DOUAE DOUKANI ,RAYANE El ALAMI  from ACTIVELABS TANGIER MOROCCO .**
.

# GOALS :
 
 **+ Our goal is to design, build, and program a self-driving car that can navigate a series of challenges autonomously. Through this competition, we aim to demonstrate our skills in robotics, programming, and problem-solving, while also learning and growing as future engineers.**

# REPOSITORY  STRUCTURE :

  **Documentation: Contains our research findings, design decisions, and technical specifications.**
  **Code: Houses our software codebase.**
  **Resources: Stores useful references, datasets, and external libraries.**
  **Media: Includes images and videos related to our project.**

# ROBOT COMPONENTS :
    
**EV3 Brick: Chosen for its versatility and compatibility with LEGO Mindstorms components.**
  
**One Big Motors: Used for forward and backward motion, providing sufficient power to move the robot efficiently**
  
**One Medium Motor: Employed for precise and easy turning of the large wheels at the rear of the EV3 kit.**

**Two big wheels: we used the rear wheels from the ev3 kit**
  
**Small Spike Wheels: Positioned at the front of the robot for enhanced maneuverability and stability.**

**Ultrasonic Sensors: Utilized for wall detection, positioned at the both ends of the brick ,enabling the robot to navigate safely within its environment.**
  
**Gyro Sensor: Implemented to simplify and improve the robot's rotational movements.**
  
**Pi-top Camera: Integrated for obstacle detection and environmental perception.**
# 3D MODEL:


# SOFTWARE LANGUAGE USED : 

**MicroPython : Used as the programming language to control the LEGO EV3 robot..**

# MAIN FEATURES : 

**Obstacle Detection: The Py-top camera, programmed in Python, detects obstacles using the object detection algorithm.**

**Autonomous Navigation: The robot is capable of navigating autonomously by avoiding obstacles and following color lines on the map.**

**Precise Control: The EV3 motors are controlled precisely to allow for smooth and accurate movements.**
